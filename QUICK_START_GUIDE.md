## 🎯 Quick Start Guide

### For Immediate Development:
1. **Start with Phase 1** - Foundation is critical
2. **Use the vanilla JavaScript stack** as recommended
3. **Follow each phase sequentially** - they build upon each other
4. **Check off items as you complete them** - track your progress
5. **Commit code after each phase** - maintain version control

### Technology Stack (Final Recommendation):
```
Frontend: HTML5 + CSS3 + Vanilla JavaScript
Effects: Canvas API + CSS Animations
Deployment: Netlify (recommended) or Vercel
Tools: VS Code + Git + Chrome DevTools
Optional: GSAP for advanced animations
```

## 📊 Project Metrics & Success Criteria

### Technical Targets:
- **Load Time**: < 3 seconds on 3G
- **Performance**: 60fps animations
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Browser Support**: 95%+ modern browsers
- **Mobile Performance**: Smooth on mid-range devices

### User Experience Goals:
- **Puzzle Completion Rate**: >60%
- **Session Duration**: >5 minutes average
