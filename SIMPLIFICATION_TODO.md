# 🎯 CYBERPUNK TERMINAL SIMPLIFICATION TODO

## 🎨 **GOAL**: Transform from overwhelming experience to smooth, user-friendly cyberpunk terminal

### 📋 **CURRENT PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED**
- ❌ Massive wall of help text appears immediately on startup  
- ❌ Information overload - users don't know what's happening
- ❌ Multiple confusing boot sequences (GRID → RETRO CYBER)
- ❌ No smooth animations - text just dumps instantly
- ❌ Poor user onboarding experience
- ❌ Too many commands shown at once (overwhelming)

### 🎯 **NEW USER EXPERIENCE VISION**
1. **Clean startup** → Matrix rain + simple terminal title
2. **Minimal welcome** → "Welcome to the Grid. Type 'help' to begin."
3. **Progressive disclosure** → Show only essential commands first
4. **Smooth animations** → Proper typewriter effects throughout
5. **Intuitive discovery** → Advanced features unlocked naturally

## 🎮 **SIMPLIFIED COMMAND SET**

### 🌟 **Essential Commands (shown in basic help)**
1. `help` - Show basic commands and getting started info
2. `about` - Brief, friendly project information  
3. `matrix` - Cool Matrix effect to engage users
4. `clear` - Clean the screen for fresh start

### 🔧 **Advanced Commands (hidden until requested)**
- File system: `ls`, `cd`, `cat`, `pwd`, etc.
- Games/Puzzles: `puzzle`, `tutorial`, `hint`, etc.  
- Testing: `test`, `probe`, `scan`, etc.
- Customization: `theme`, `sound`, `animations`, etc.
- Special: `secrets`, `admin`, `konami`, etc.

### 📖 **Progressive Disclosure Strategy**
- `help` → Shows 4 essential commands + "Type 'help advanced' for more"
- `help advanced` → Shows organized command categories
- `help all` → Shows comprehensive command list (current behavior)
- Commands naturally hint at related features
