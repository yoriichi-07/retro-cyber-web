## üéØ Key Objectives

1. **Authentic CRT Experience**: Make the terminal look and feel like a real vintage CRT monitor
2. **Smooth Performance**: Ensure all effects run smoothly on various devices
3. **Visual Immersion**: Create effects that enhance the cyberpunk atmosphere
4. **Responsive Design**: Maintain quality across different screen sizes

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Notes

### Matrix Rain Enhancements
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smoother animation
- Implement character pooling to reduce garbage collection
- Add WebGL support for high-performance rendering

### CRT Effects Implementation
- Use CSS filters and transforms for screen curvature
- Implement custom shaders for advanced effects
- Create noise textures for static overlay

### Performance Considerations
- Monitor frame rates and optimize accordingly
- Use CSS containment for better rendering performance
- Implement effect quality settings for different devices

## üìÅ Files to Create/Modify

### New Files
- `src/css/components/matrix.css` - Matrix rain specific styles
- `src/css/components/crt.css` - CRT effects and styling
- `src/css/components/animations.css` - Animation definitions
- `src/js/effects.js` - Visual effects controller
- `src/js/performance.js` - Performance monitoring

### Files to Modify
- `src/css/main.css` - Add new effect imports
- `src/js/main.js` - Integrate effects system
- `index.html` - Add effect containers

## üé® Visual Design Goals

1. **Screen Curvature**: Subtle barrel distortion to simulate CRT screen
2. **Glow Effects**: Realistic phosphor glow around text
3. **Color Bleeding**: RGB separation for authentic CRT look
4. **Scanlines**: Dynamic scanlines that respond to content
5. **Static Noise**: Subtle noise overlay for vintage feel

## üì± Mobile Optimizations

- Reduce effect intensity on mobile devices
- Use CSS media queries for device-specific effects
- Implement touch-specific interactions
- Optimize for battery life

## üîß Development Workflow

1. Start with matrix rain enhancements
2. Implement basic CRT curvature
3. Add glow and phosphor effects  
4. Create scanline improvements
5. Add static noise and artifacts
6. Optimize performance across devices
7. Test on various screen sizes and devices

## üìä Success Metrics

- Smooth 60fps performance on desktop
- Smooth 30fps performance on mobile
- Realistic CRT appearance
- Enhanced immersion factor
- Maintained accessibility

## üö¶ Getting Started with Phase 2

To begin Phase 2 development:

1. Review this guide thoroughly
2. Set up the development environment (already complete)
3. Create the new CSS component files
4. Implement matrix rain enhancements first
5. Test each effect individually before combining
6. Use the test.html file to verify functionality
